### About me

I am a CNRS researcher focusing on the mechanics of soft and hard polymer networks, and more specifically on how heterogeneous architectures can impact and potentially improve their mechanical and physical response.

I have completed a PhD thesis in Materials Science in the group of _Pr. Thomas Pardoen_ at UCLouvain in Belgium. Then, I have pursued a post-doctoral stay in the group of _Pr. Zhigang Suo_ at Harvard University in the field of Soft Active Materials for two years. As a second postdoc, I worked on the mechanics and fracture of multiple-network elastomers and pressure-sensitive adhesives in the Laboratory of Soft Matter Science and Engineering at ESPCI Paris along with _Pr. Costantino Creton_ and _Pr. Matteo Ciccotti_. I have now joined the Polymer Materials Engineering Lab (IMP - UMR5223) at INSA-Lyon where I am now building my own research group.

To learn more details on my background, have a look at my [CV](/DownloadableFiles/CV_XavierMORELLE_october2022.pdf).

### Recent news

- **12/2022** : Go have a quick look at the **General audience media** section for a small ad on the novel work initiative in medical engineering developped in Lyon around building an artificial organ platform for medical devices validation through the MIMIMed project that I will co-manage with Guilhem Rival (principal project carrier) from LGEF laboratory and Rémy Gauthier from Matéis lab.

- **10/2022** : Welcome to Barthelemy Gros who joins the IMP lab to start his PhD, co-supervised with Paul Sotta, Jean-François Gérard and myself. He will be focusing on the detection of early damage by nano-cavitation in the polymer liner of hyperbar hydrogen tanks as part of the HYPERSTOCK project insisde the Decarbonated Hydrogen National Consortium #PEPR_H2. 

- **09/2022** : I am happy to announce a new collaboration with Hutchinson Research & Innovation Center who will be funding the master thesis project of Clémence Taffner who will be working on the durability of Fuel cells seals in acidic environment.

- **06/2022** : Congrats to Loup Mambré who has succesfully secured his funding for a ministry-funded (MESR) PhD after a well-prepared and executed oral defense at the Ecole Doctorale 34 of Lyon! => Enjoy some well-deserved holidays Loup before coming back in the fall to start working on ionic-liquid modified epoxy networks!

- **04/2022** : Conference series coming up! I will have the pleasure to present some of my previous work first at the European Mechanics of Materials Conference (EMMC18) in Oxford and then move to the Rolduc Abbey in the Netherlands to attend for my first time to the very famous DYFP (Deformation Yield and Fracture of Polymers) conference. Looking forward to these events to catch up with old colleagues and friends from all over Europe.

- **03/2022** : Congratulations to both Noémie Maamouri and Joanna Baudino who just finished their master thesis resarch project with a very-well performed oral defense! => Good luck in your future endeavours starting with your industry internship!
While Noemie worked on a fundamental research project to better apprehend the molecular architecture of Room Temperature Vulcanization (RTV) silicon elastomers, Joanna performed an applied research project in collaboration with Solvay R&D Center in order to toughen epoxy network with organic fillers.


### Scientific Vision and Projects

_keywords_ : mechanics and fracture of polymer networks, multi-scale characterization, micro-mechanical modeling, design of smart active materials.

A common trait throughout my whole research experience is the strong will of seeking a better molecular understanding of polymer networks deformation and fracture micromechanisms, in order to _in-fine_ establish more clearly the relation between polymer microstructure and their macroscopic properties. Building on the knowledge of this rather theoretical quest, I also envision to tackle more multi-disciplinary and coupled problems through the study and design of soft active materials. The area of soft matter mechanics being extremely vast, it still offers plenty of room for new exciting developments.

Prospective research on the large strain and fracture behavior of ionic liquid (IL) modified polymer systems. The first step focuses on controlling the mechanical behavior through the topological nano-structuration of a phosphonium-ionic liquid epoxy system, while in second step multi-functional responses will be also considered, taking advantage of IL conductivity and thermal properties. The work is performed in the laboratoire d'Ingénierie des Matériaux Polymères (IMP) in collaboration with S. Livi & Pr. S. Pruvost.
