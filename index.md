### About me

I have completed a PhD thesis in Materials Science in the group of Pr. Thomas Pardoen at UCL in Belgium. Then, I have pursued with a post-doctoral stay in the group of Pr. Zhigang Suo at Harvard University in the field of Soft Active Materials for 2 years. I am now working in the Laboratory of Soft Matter Science and Engineering at ESPCI ParisTech with Pr. Costantino Creton and Pr. Matteo Ciccotti.

During the thesis, I have worked in the field of polymer mechanics and more especially, on the characterization and modeling of the mechanical and micro-mechanical behavior of RTM6 epoxy resin. Through a strong experimental work basis, I have come to highlight an elasto-viscoelastic-viscoplastic behavior of the epoxy and also identified simple fracture criteria. Instead of relying on purely phenomenological descriptions of the material behavior, I focused on the understanding of the underlying micro-mechanisms, and proposed a physics-based original theory, capable of reproducing the complete range of experimental results.
