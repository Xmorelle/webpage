### About me

I have completed a PhD thesis in Materials Science in the group of Pr. Thomas Pardoen at UCL in Belgium. Then, I have pursued with a post-doctoral stay in the group of Pr. Zhigang Suo at Harvard University in the field of Soft Active Materials for 2 years. I am now working in the Laboratory of Soft Matter Science and Engineering at ESPCI ParisTech with Pr. Costantino Creton and Pr. Matteo Ciccotti.

During the thesis, I have worked in the field of polymer mechanics and more especially, on the characterization and modeling of the mechanical and micro-mechanical behavior of RTM6 epoxy resin. Through a strong experimental work basis, I have come to highlight an elasto-viscoelastic-viscoplastic behavior of the epoxy and also identified simple fracture criteria. Instead of relying on purely phenomenological descriptions of the material behavior, I focused on the understanding of the underlying micro-mechanisms, and proposed a physics-based original theory, capable of reproducing the complete range of experimental results.

```
# 2017 - now : ESPCI | PSL, Paris, FRANCE 
```
Fundamental research using mechano-chemistry as a tool to study the mechanics and fracture of soft polymer networks, going from adhesives to hydrogels and elastomers. A focus is set on the understanding of the fatigue behavior and the toughening mechanisms occuring in multiple network hydrogels and elastomers through optical analysis of fluorescent molecular markers.

# 2015 - 2017 : School of Engineering and Applied Science | Harvard, Cambridge - MA, USA
```
Research in the field of soft active materials in the group of Pr. Zhigang Suo. My research involved the preparation of tough hydrogels, their specific mechanical and fracture characterization under a large variety of testing conditions (from sub-zero temperatures to fatigue loading), as well as the development of new engineering devices making use of their multifunctional properties.

# 2011 - 2015 : IMAP, iMMC | UCLouvain, Louvain-la-Neuve, BELGIUM
```
Research in materials science with both experimental and modeling work in the field of mechanics of polymers and polymer-based composites. Development of an original physics-based theory for modelling the meso-scale heterogeneous micro-mechanisms of glassy polymers.
Collaborations on applied research projects with the aeronautical industry (Safran group, TechSpace Aero, Sonaca), as well as fundamental research with other international groups (KULeuven, Trinity College, IMDEA, Imperial College), were pursued in parallel.
