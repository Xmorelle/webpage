### About me

I am an enthousiastic post-doctoral researcher focusing on the mechanics of soft polymer networks.
I have completed a PhD thesis in Materials Science in the group of Pr. Thomas Pardoen at UCLouvain in Belgium. Then, I have pursued a post-doctoral stay in the group of Pr. Zhigang Suo at Harvard University in the field of Soft Active Materials for two years. I am now working in the Laboratory of Soft Matter Science and Engineering at ESPCI Paris with Pr. Costantino Creton and Pr. Matteo Ciccotti.

To learn more details on my backgroung, have a look at my [CV](/DownloadableFiles/CV_XavierMORELLE_sept2019.pdf).

### Scientific Vision and Projects

_keywords_ : mechanics and fracture of soft polymer networks, multi-scale characterization approach, micro-mechanical physics-based modeling, design of smart multifunctional devices.

A common trait throughout my whole research experience is the strong will of seeking a better molecular understanding of polymer networks deformation and fracture micromechanisms, in order to _in-fine_ establish more clearly the relation between polymer microstructure and their macroscopic properties. Building on the knowledge of this rather theoretical quest, I also envision to tackle more multi-disciplinary and coupled problems through the study and design of soft active materials. The area of soft matter mechanics being extremely vast, it still offers plenty of room for new exciting developments.

```
Fundamental research using mechano-chemistry as a tool to study the mechanics and fracture of soft polymer networks, going from adhesives to hydrogels and elastomers. A focus is set on the understanding of the toughening mechanisms occuring in multiple network hydrogels and elastomers through optical analysis of fluorescent molecular markers.
